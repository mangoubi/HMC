# HMC
All files are writted in MATLAB code

The file synthetic_data_generate.m generates synthetic data with inpus "d" (the dimension) and "r" (the number of data points).

The file HMC_and_Langevin.m  runs the HMC or Langevin algorithms.  Which algorithm is run (HMC or Langevin) and the parameters can be set by the user.


The file L2__Vs__L_infty  approximates the values of the Lipschitz Hessian constant $L2$ and the infinity-norm Lipschitz constant $L_\infty$ at different values of the dimension $d$ for synthetic data.
